# Election Audit
## Project Overview
The objective is to provide an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. Previously, the Python script was able to run the following information: total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes each candidate received, percentage of votes each candidate won, and winner of the election based on popular vote. Due to a recent discussion from the board, further information will be provided. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to provide additional information to the election audit.  The analysis will provide the following information for the election commission: voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and county with the highest turnout.
